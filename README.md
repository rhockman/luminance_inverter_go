# Luminance Inverter

I was bothered by the slow speed of my [Python luminance converter](https://github.com/rhockman/luminance_inverter) so I threw together a go-based one this evening.

It's nothing special, but it's shockingly faster than the Python one.

Images must be PNGs or JPGs and reside in the `testdata` folder.  Running the program inverts the luminance and outputs the results as PNG files in the `converted` folder.
